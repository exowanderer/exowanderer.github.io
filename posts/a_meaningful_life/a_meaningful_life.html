        Working for NASA can be one of the most meaningful lives worth living.

    As a teenager, I wanted to be an astronaut and live on Mars. In fact, I would still take that opportunity if it was offered to me. When I was 4 years old, I wanted to fly jet airplanes at full speed.  And when I was 15, I took a biology course with one of my favorite professors in high school (the 4 years before college). I asked him hundreds and hundreds of questions about biology, about nuclei, about DNA, and about proteins in the cells.  I told him that I want to be a biologist; and he said "no you don't, everything you've ever asked me is actually about physics, not biology". And he was such a brilliant professor that he let me write our end-of-the-year research paper (~4 pages) on space flight technology to Mars, which has nothing to do with biology. From that day forward, I wanted to work for NASA as an "Astrobiologist", which is exactly what I have been doing for the last 12 years.
</p>
<p>
    I say all of this to reinforce that dreams are important and wonderful, and they should shape how you approach life and what decisions you make to achieve them. More important for me was also to have supportive professors (and later advisors) who understood my dreams, my goals, my abilities, and how we can shape them together into a meaningful life.  That last part is the most important message that I want to give you: seek your dreams and work within them to live a meaningful life.  
</p>
<p>
    Working for NASA is indeed 'living a meaningful life'.  NASA (and ESA, CSA, ISA, etc) helps humanity understand that we are all one people; one species. One of the greatest images of humanity as a whole was taken from the surface of the moon, looking back on Earth. There were no borders, no walls, no separations that keep us all apart; there was just a continuous flow of humanity across the green and blue surface of our home world. No person could be seen from space, nor buildings or even cities; but knowing that we are all there -- all of us -- together in this one special place helps weave the reality that we are together.
</p>
<p>
    There may be 1000 habitable worlds across our galaxy; and maybe 10 that our spacecraft can get to after ~100s of years of travel; but none of them are our home; and none of them are our people. We may not be able to breathe the air or drink the 'water' or crop the soil because we ourselves are biologically incapable to adapt to those worlds. We may not be able to collaborate with the indigenous people or understand their language and customs. Of course, we should try; but, we must learn to live together here on Earth, in our home first.
</p>
<p>
    NASA provides humanity with a glimpse into the universe; but also the knowledge that we are small. We are a speck of dust orbiting a bigger, glowing spec of dust that orbits a collection of more dust and gas, which we call the milky way.  From the vantage point of another star, our entire solar system (Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth) are not even dots of light in the darkness; our star ('the sun') is a faint glimmer of light on an alien camera. We may not be alone in the Universe, or even the galaxy, but we are in the only place that we can call home, the only place that we know we can breathe the air, drink the water, and speak the language. That is why I love to work for NASA.
</p>
<p>
    There are literally ~20k people who work at NASA and another several 100k who work with NASA.  Each of those people has had a unique path through life that led to to and from NASA. Several Lebanese professors have worked with or for NASA (and ESA), such as Dr. Cyrine Nehme of NDU and Dr. Nelly Mouawad of LAU. Moreover, the Director of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for over 20 years was Dr. Charles Elachi (born and raised in Lebanon); JPL runs almost all of NASA's Mars Missions. The director of the NASA Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) is Dr. George Helou (born and raised in Lebanon);

    I was a NASA contractor at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates and calibrates both the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes -- as well as working with dozens of other space telescopes and missions.  The team that I worked with were friends since before I started working there. I had known most of them for years, even a decade. So my starting position was better than what most could hope. There were plenty of interesting and curious people who I met after working there; and I worked with the kindest and most understanding team leader that I had ever known.
